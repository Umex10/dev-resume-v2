/**
 * Next.js 16 middleware (named `proxy` in this version) that gates the app on
 * the presence of the refresh-token cookie.
 *
 * - Unauthenticated visits to a protected route are redirected to `/sign-in`.
 * - Authenticated visits to the landing page (`/`), `/sign-in` or `/sign-up`
 *   are bounced straight to `/dashboard` — if you already have a refresh cookie
 *   there is no reason to show you the marketing/auth pages again. The landing
 *   redirect additionally carries a `?redirected=1` flag so the dashboard can
 *   explain *why* you landed there (see `app/(shell)/dashboard/page.tsx`).
 * - The landing and auth pages stay publicly reachable for logged-out visitors
 *   so they can browse without an infinite redirect loop.
 *
 * This is a cheap presence check (does the cookie exist?), not a validity
 * check — the actual token verification happens on the backend. That keeps the
 * middleware fast and lets it run on every navigation.
